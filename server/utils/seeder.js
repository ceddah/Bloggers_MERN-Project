    content:
      "Likability is a weird quality. Plenty of people are fans of Aretha Franklin or Bob Dylan, but it’s not because either of them spent a lot of time mailing out Christmas cards or being particularly warm to their fans. Google doesn’t do tech support and plenty of popular high-end restaurants got that way by being difficult to book and not particularly welcoming to new patrons. One reason is that we’re drawn to status. To like something as a way of certifying our insight or rank. But there’s a different path, one that’s far easier to maintain and travel. It’s simple: Like your customers and they’re more likely to like you back. This is one reason that the Beatles switched their focus after their first US tour (and eventually stopped touring). They couldn’t figure out how to like the screaming young fans that didn’t have much in the way of discernment. Instead, they shifted to writing and producing music for fans and colleagues that they wanted to spend their time liking. If you want to be more liked, begin by liking.",

    title: "How to Fix the 413 Request Entity Too Large Error",
    content:
      "The most straightforward way to fix the 413 Request Entity Too Large error is to add a code snippet to your functions.php file. The good news is this is something we cover in a dedicated article on increasing your maximum file size in WordPress. In this article, we also cover how to alter your .htaccess file to achieve the same result. A text editor displaying a .htaccess file. The difference is that your functions.php file relates to WordPress, while .htaccess is for an Apache-based server. The majority of the time, you won’t need to add snippets to both. There’s a slight difference when it comes to Nginx servers. The relevant file you need here is nginx.conf. However, on the vast majority of servers, you won’t be able to access this file in the same way you do .htaccess. There is some configuration you can do, as we show in our article on fixing broken permalinks, but Nginx servers often don’t provide the same ability to tinker as Apache servers. Our advice is to contact your host if you have an Nginx server and you see the 413 Request Entity Too Large error. They will be able to diagnose the issue in the correct way, and make the necessary changes to your server, without further errors. In Summary If you come across the 413 Request Entity Too Large error, you’ll likely wonder what it means. However, it can be simple to decipher – usually you’re uploading files that are too large – and fix. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes in most cases to put things right and get your site back online. For this post, we have looked at three ways to fix the 413 Request Entity Too Large error. You can try using SFTP to upload files to your server, and also check permissions. You’re also able to edit the functions.php, .htaccess, and nginx.conf files to get back online. In lots of situations, you won’t need to touch your server’s core files – but it’s straightforward to do if you need to.",

      "What are Tiktok cinnamon rolls? This viral hack is everywhere on Tiktok and it’s super simple: store bought cinnamon rolls baked in heavy whipping cream. The rolls bake up light, fluffy, moist, and extra gooey. The layer of heavy whipping cream bakes into the buns giving them more heft and lightness as well as helps the tops bake to a beautiful golden brown. tiktok cinnamon rolls | www.iamafoodblog.com Who invented the Tiktok cinnamon roll hack? There are so many people who are doing this now and it’s kind of hard to tell who started the trend, but personally I saw @mississippi_kween and @mantha do it on my for you page. If you know who invented it, please let me know! How to make Tiktok cinnamon rolls with heavy cream This cinnamon roll hack is incredibly easy, just like all viral hacks. Preheat your oven to 350°F. Butter a large baking dish. Add the cinnamon rolls, spaced apart so they can rise and bake up fluffy. Pour heavy whipping cream over the tops of the cinnamon rolls. Bake according to the package directions. Add the frosting on while they’re still warm, but not hot, let cool slightly and enjoy! adding cream to tiktok cinnamon rolls | www.iamafoodblog.com TikTok cinnamon roll hack ingredients You only need two ingredients for this hack: store-bought ready to bake cinnamon rolls and heavy whipping cream. Store bought cinnamon rolls You want the refrigerated ready to bake rolls that come in tubes. There are so many brands out there and all of them will work, but if you want the specific ones I’ve seen on TikTok, they’re they’re Pillsbury Grands, more on that below. tiktok cinnamon rolls | www.iamafoodblog.com Heavy whipping cream Heavy whipping cream is the secret ingredient. It adds extra moistness and richness to the buns, making they super fluffy and gooey when they bake up. They also help the tops bake up to a beautiful golden brown. How to open a cinnamon roll can To be honest, opening tubes of cinnamon rolls or biscuits scares me because of the pop. I always think that the rolls are going to explode. What I like to do is, peel the outside paper off, carefully, and if that doesn’t open the package, I hold the tube and gently twist in opposite directions so the seams of the cardboard tube expands and opens. You can also gently knock it against the counter top to break the seam.",

      "Amanda Hocking is making a million dollars a year publishing her own work to the Kindle. No publisher. Rebecca Black has reached more than 15,000,000 listeners, like it or not, without a record label. Are we better off without gatekeepers? Well, it was gatekeepers that brought us the unforgettable lyrics of Terry Jacks in 1974, and it’s gatekeepers that are spending a fortune bringing out pop songs and books that don’t sell. I’m not sure that this is even the right question. Whether or not we’re better off, the fact is that the gatekeepers–the pickers–are reeling, losing power and fading away. What are you going to do about it? It’s a cultural instinct to wait to get picked. To seek out the permission and authority that comes from a publisher or talk show host or even a blogger saying, “I pick you.” Once you reject that impulse and realize that no one is going to select you–that Prince Charming has chosen another house–then you can actually get to work. If you’re hoping that the HR people you sent your resume to are about to pick you, it’s going to be a long wait. Once you understand that there are problems just waiting to be solved, once you realize that you have all the tools and all the permission you need, then opportunities to contribute abound. No one is going to pick you. Pick yourself.",

    content:
      "These days, with technology driving the collection and production of massive quantities of data, it’s relatively easy to get your hands on information that can guide your daily decisions. Mobile apps draw on heart rate and other biometric data to track health and exercise goals. They provide real-time data on investments, personal spending, and budgeting. They can even help parents assess their newborns’ feeding and sleep patterns. To grasp the sheer volume of data available, look no further than designer Nicholas Felton’s annual reports constructed from his own personal data. With so much information at your fingertips, the hard part is making sense of it. This is where animation can help. Animating data makes it more comprehensible, engaging, and useful, particularly on the small screens of mobile devices. With animation, numbers become easier to digest and otherwise overlooked trends, patterns, and narratives become apparent. Real-time interactivity with these visuals promotes engagement and allows users to explore data more deeply. At the same time, excessive or misguided animation can defeat its purpose, obscuring rather than illuminating insights. When animating mobile data visualizations, designers should use motion design principles—and avoid common pitfalls. The Benefits of Animating Mobile Data Visualizations Animation isn’t a mere embellishment to data visualizations. Motion offers myriad benefits, and it should be applied with the goal of achieving a specific outcome. Helping users perceive trends and changes is a key advantage of using motion in data visualizations. The late academic Hans Rosling is known for an animation in which he plotted lifespan and income data to show changes in health and wealth for dozens of countries over decades. It’s a captivating animation that clarifies trends over time and counteracts common perceptions about global development.",

    content:
      "Ok total change of plans today - it’s the last sunny day before (apparently) a week of rain, so I wanted to make sure I got up to Loen today, even if it meant extra driving/coming back on my tracks. About half the drive was normal highway, half was the narrow roads - I’m getting used to them at least..! I went through this nice valley with super green waters and tiny waterfalls galore. Not many spots to stop, but got a few pics and ate my breakky at one. The closer I got to Loen, the more questionable the cloud cover got which really had me worried - I would’ve been so mad had I drove all this way for clouds haha but thankfully it was… I won’t say clearing up, but there were pockets of sun coming out which meant it was really the perfect day for it - you wait 20min and you have diff pics/landscapes lol. The cable car was surprisingly smooth - I’m used to a bit of a bumpy ride from Switzerland lol. (On the way down you get a real nice swing though as you leave the station! Love it!) And Those colours!Those colours! Those colours! it was expensive as is the norm here… but omg it was worth it, just stunning..!! It takes a lot for me to audibly go 'wow' but the view was def 'wow' worthy - the colours, the swirling clouds, all of it. I did a mini hike just around the top (Hoven) - didn’t want to get lost in cloud cover lol I spent most of my time near the cafe terrace - perfect to watch the clouds come and go, watch the colours change and people watch a bit. Ugh it is just so beautiful here. When the sun hits the water, it’s always so vivid..!! I had debated doing the zip line - I’m glad I didn’t. The pics online made it look super long but in reality it’s pretty dinky and stupid expensive for what it is. Like, I think the Ottawa/Gatineau one is longer. Ah well. Not sure anything will ever beat the Swiss one in the mountains anyway. After Loen I made my way back towards Forde, doing a pit stop in Skei and headed over towards a nearby glacier. The parking was a zoo / total disaster so I managed to So happy up hereSo happy up here So happy up here get away / turn around and parked in a photo stop not far away and just walked back. Meh, I think you could walk closer if you went in behind the restaurant, but as you can imagine, it's quite the receding glacier. I headed back towards Forde after that and just puttered around. Not sure what I'll do tomorrow with the rain / considering I already did my plan for tomorrow. We’ll see!",

    title: "Birria Tacos Recipe",
    content:
      "What are Birria Tacos? Birria is traditionally a spicy and super savory Mexican beef or goat stew that’s slow cooked until the meat is tender and fall-apart juicy and delicious. Someone had the amazing idea to stuff this meaty goodness into a taco shell, and then dip the whole thing into the stew and fry it up. These birria tacos blew up after that, and the rest is history. Birria Tacos Recipe | www.iamafoodblog.com Beef birria tacos While birria is traditionally made with goat, for most of us it’s easier to get beef so that’s what I’ve gone with here. Beef is also the safer choice for crowds, but if you’re an adventurous eater and want to go with goat, you should totally go(at) for it. The recipe remains the same, just switch out the beef shank and sirloin for goat. The best birria tacos are dipped in the stew and then fried to crispy goodness It’s really in dipping the tortilla into the stew and frying it to a crisp that the magic happens, so don’t skip this step. Tacos are good but very few people who don’t live in the southwest know that tacos only become truly transcendent once you cook the tortilla in fat. Traditionally they do this in butter or lard, but here we use the fat from the top of the stew to give it that extra kick. Once you bite into a crisp fried taco shell, you’ll never go back. Birria Tacos Recipe | www.iamafoodblog.com Instant pot birria You can make this stew any way you like, but I prefer it in the instant pot because it’s so much faster, and keeps more of the flavor locked inside the dish. Those yummy smells that fill up your house when you slow cook for hours? Those are flavor particles, and that means that’s flavor that’s not in your soup. But, regardless of how you make this, it’ll come out absolutely delicious, so pick whatever method is best for you. Birria Tacos Recipe | www.iamafoodblog.com Dutch Oven To cook this in a dutch oven, you’ll need a fairly large dutch oven. Follow the instructions all the way until you close the lid of the Instant Pot. Instead, cover the dutch oven and set it on as low heat as possible on your stove, or alternatively, pop it in a 200ºF oven for 4-6 hours.",

    title: "Deepfakes are taking over TikTok — here’s how you can spot them",
    content:
      "One of the world’s most popular social media platforms, TikTok, is now host to a steady stream of deepfake videos. Deepfakes are videos in which a subject’s face or body has been digitally altered to make them look like someone else – usually a famous person. One notable example is the @deeptomcriuse TikTok account, which has posted dozens of deepfake videos impersonating Tom Cruise and attracted some 3.6 million followers. Greetings, humanoids Subscribe to our newsletter now for a weekly recap of our favorite AI stories in your inbox. Your email address I agree to allow TNW to store and process my personal data* Deepfakes gained a lot of media attention last year, with videos impersonating Hollywood actor Tom Cruise going viral. In another example, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to be confessing to conspiratorial data sharing. More recently there have been a number of silly videos featuring actors such as Robert Pattinson and Keanu Reeves. Although deepfakes are often used creatively or for fun, they’re increasingly being deployed in disinformation campaigns, for identity fraud, and to discredit public figures and celebrities. And while the technology needed to make them is sophisticated, it’s becoming increasingly accessible, leaving detection software and regulation lagging behind. One thing is for sure – deepfakes are here to stay. So what can we do about them? Varying roles The manipulation of text, images, and footage has long been a bedrock of interactivity. And deepfakes are no exception; they’re the outcome of a deep-seated desire to participate in culture, storytelling, art, and remixing. The technology is used extensively in the digital arts and satire. It provides more refined (and cheaper) techniques for visual insertions, compared to green screens and computer-generated imagery. Deepfake technology can also enable authentic-looking resurrections of deceased actors and historical re-enactments. They may even play a role in helping people grieve their deceased loved ones. Comedian Jordan Peele provides a voiceover of a deepfake with former US President Barack Obama. But they’re also available for misuse At the same time, deepfake technology is thought to present several social problems such as: Deepfakes are being used as “proof” for other fake news and disinformation. Deepfakes are being used to discredit celebrities and others whose livelihood depends on sharing content while maintaining a reputation. Difficulties providing verifiable footage for political communication, health messaging, and electoral campaigns. People’s faces are being used in deepfake pornography. The last point is of particular concern. In 2019, deepfake detection software firm Deeptrace found that 96% of 14,000 deepfakes were pornographic in nature. Free apps such as the now-defunct DeepNude 2.0 have been used to make clothed women appear nude in the footage, often for revenge porn and blackmail.",
